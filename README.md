# Sign Language Recognition and Translation System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sign Language Recognition and Translation System, an innovative project designed to bridge communication gaps for the hearing-impaired. This system utilizes cutting-edge machine learning technologies, including TensorFlow and Keras, to accurately recognize  and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. Our goal is to convert these gestures into corresponding textual output, thereby facilitating seamless communication for individuals who rely on sign language. This project not only showcases the potential of AI in enhancing accessibility but also represents a step towards more inclusive communication technologies. Whether you're a student, developer, or someone interested in assistive technology, we invite you to explore and contribute to this meaningful venture.
